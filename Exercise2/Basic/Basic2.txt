Pros:
    - Fast and easy implementation.
    - Because the implementation is straightforward testing ist easy, too.

Cons:
    - Recursion is slow because a lot of subroutines are called (Huge call stack).
    - Often pixels get checked multiple times because neighboring pixels trigger up to four recursive calls for a certain pixel. But only one call is necessary to know if a pixel should be colored or not.
