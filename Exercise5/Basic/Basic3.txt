In task 5.1 you can see that for a certain number of line segments (e.g. 4 in 5.1b and 5 in 5.1c) the specular highlight in the middle disappears.
That is because in flat and Gouraud shading we only look at certain representors of the line segments. If their calculated lighting does not "include" a specular highlight the whole segment can not have a specular highlight because the shading expands the "wrong" lighting to the whole segment.
In Phong shading there is not such a problem because instead of using interpolation (Gouraud) or setting a fixed value (Flat) each single pixel gets calculated according to the phong shading model.
